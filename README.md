Images Metadata Cleaner
Images Metadata Cleaner is a tool designed to remove metadata from image files. The tool can be used in two different ways: as a Python script that can be executed in your IDE, or as a standalone executable (.exe) file that you can run directly in a folder containing your images.

Features
Clean Metadata: Removes all EXIF metadata from .jpg, .jpeg, and .png files.
Two Usage Methods:
Python Script: Run the code directly in your Python environment.
Executable: Use the standalone .exe file to clean metadata from images in a specific folder.
